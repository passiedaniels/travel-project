              <h3>why Portugal?</h3>
              <h2>Portugal land of beauty</h2>

              <p>
                Portugal, a country nestled on Europe’s southwestern edge, is a
                treasure trove of unique experiences. When one asks what is
                famous in Portugal, the answers are as diverse as the country
                itself. From iconic Portugal landmarks like the Tower of Belém
                and Pena Palace to famous things in Portugal such as Fado music,
                Port wine, and the captivating tradition of Azulejos.
              </p>
              <p>
                The allure of Portugal extends beyond these known things from
                Portugal. It’s in the Portuguese stuff, the culture, the people,
                the cuisine, and the lifestyle that truly defines this charming
                nation and leaves a lasting impression on its visitors.
